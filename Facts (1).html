<li>The water from your faucet could contain molecules that dinosaurs drank.</li>
<li>Water is composed of two elements, Hydrogen and Oxygen.</li>
<li>2 Hydrogen + 1 Oxygen = H2O.</li>
<li>Nearly 97% of the world’s water is salty or otherwise undrinkable.</li>

<li>Water regulates the Earth’s temperature.</li>
<li>It also regulates the temperature of the human body, carries nutrients and oxygen to cells, cushions joints, protects organs and tissues, and removes wastes.</li>
<li>75% of the human brain is water and 75% of a living tree is water.</li>
<li>A person can live about a month without food, but only about a week without water.</li>
